# HGMServers Shutdown Notice

We announce the official shutdown of HGMServers.

These past two years have been an incredible journey, and we want to express our gratitude to each and every one of you who contributed to this community. We understand that some users may have experienced performance issues recently, and we want to clarify that it was due to necessary backend work and the meticulous process of backing up our game servers and databases.

Although HGMServers is now offline, our Discord will remain open for those who wish to stay connected, whether it be for the emojis or simply to stay in touch. At this time, we do not have an official comeback date in sight, as we believe it's time to explore new paths.

For those seeking a similar gaming experience, we recommend checking out the servers of one of our senior admins and a dear friend, CoreyUK who owns the CUKServers. They share our passion for providing a great gaming environment, and we trust that they will offer a fantastic alternative for both Zombies & Multiplayer Servers.

Thank you all for being a part of the HGMServers community.
